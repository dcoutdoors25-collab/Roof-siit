    <div class="card">
        <p>
            Roof Armor was created to give homeowners a smarter choice between ignoring an aging roof
            and paying for a full replacement. We specialize in roof life extension, not tear-offs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Using our hybrid 3-step system, we help Metro Atlanta homeowners extend the life of their
            existing shingle roofs, prevent leaks, and protect their biggest investment — their home.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our focus is simple: honest inspections, clear communication, and high-quality work that
            actually solves problems and saves money.
